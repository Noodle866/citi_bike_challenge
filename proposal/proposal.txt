Design 2–5 visualizations for each discovered phenomenon (4–10 total)

Four phenomenon's chosen for challenge 18:

	Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?

	Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? Based on data, why?

	Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? Based on data, why?

	Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? Based on data, why?
	
Each questions needs:
 
	Analysis is written in a markdown file or included in the Tableau Public workbook
 
	Analysis describes the dashboards and any interesting data discoveries contained within them

	Analysis on the chosen city official requested map detailing any noticeable trends 

	The written analysis references specific visualizations and interactive features 
	
	The document is written in a manner that a non-technical reader could understand

MAP:

	Basic: A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey, with zip code data overlaid on top.

FINAL:
 
	Create a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.
